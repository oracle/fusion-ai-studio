# Succession Planning

## Functional Solution Approach

The Succession Planning workspace is an AI-powered Oracle HCM experience for managers who need a single place to review succession coverage, talent strength, retention risk, role criticality, and compensation context for their direct teams. The solution is implemented through a parent workspace, Succession Readiness Workspace, and a person-level drill-down workspace, Person Succession Readiness Workspace.

The parent workspace presents manager-facing panels backed by AI Studio workflows that gather relevant HCM context, render business-facing views, and support direct follow-up through row actions or natural-language queries. The drill-down workspace receives selected employee context and presents focused person-level panels for succession readiness, risk of loss, impact of loss, and compensation history.

## Design Principles

| Principle | Functional meaning |
|---|---|
| Single pane | Bring succession readiness, performance, risk, impact, and compensation into one workspace so managers do not need to move across separate tools for the first review. |
| Progressive disclosure | Show a summary first, then let managers open employee-level detail only when they need deeper context. |
| AI-driven triage | Use workflow-backed panels to surface coverage gaps, higher-risk employees, high-impact roles, and performance-based talent groups. |
| Action-oriented | Connect insight to action through employee drill-down, successor suggestions, candidate review, and successor creation. |

## Panels in Scope

| Panel | Primary goal |
|---|---|
| Succession Overview | Review succession plan availability, successor readiness, and bench-strength gaps across direct reports. |
| Risk of Loss | Identify direct reports with elevated retention risk who may require manager attention. |
| Impact of Loss | Highlight employees whose departure could create meaningful business impact. |
| Top Performers | Surface higher-performing employees to support recognition, growth, and succession planning. |
| Talent Needing Assistance | Identify employees with lower performance ratings who may need coaching, support, or development planning. |
| Compensation Summary | Review compensation details for direct reports to support balanced talent and pay decisions. |
| Succession Information | Review person-level succession, performance, risk, impact, and compensation attributes in one drill-down view. |
| Risk of Loss Drill-Down | Review an individual employee's current risk rating and short explanatory summary. |
| Impact of Loss Drill-Down | Review an individual employee's impact rating and short explanatory summary. |
| Compensation History Drill-Down | Review an employee's annual salary trend over time. |

## Succession Overview Panel

### Goal

The Succession Overview panel helps managers identify which direct reports have succession coverage, which employees have no succession plan, and which covered roles have no ready-now successor. It is the main triage panel for successor readiness and follow-up action.

### Data Sources

| Data source | Functional use |
|---|---|
| Succession details lookup | Provides direct report identity, assignment, succession plan count, readiness categories, and candidate readiness data. |
| Logged-in employee context | Identifies the manager context used to fetch direct reports and pass manager identifiers through row actions. |
| Compensation details lookup | Adds current salary, quartile, and quintile context when a manager reviews employee detail. |
| Talent ratings lookup | Adds performance, risk of loss, and impact of loss context for an employee detail view. |
| Employee tree context | Supplies employee and manager hierarchy details used during detail and candidate review flows. |
| Succession plan creation services | Build and submit the payload needed to create a succession plan and add incumbents. |
| Supporting workflow | Potential Succession Candidates retrieves ranked successor candidates when the manager asks for suggestions. |

### User Flow

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 | Manager opens the workspace and sees succession coverage for direct reports. |
| 2 | Manager expands the panel and sees supporting risk, impact, and succession information views. |
| 3 | Manager selects an employee and reviews employee-level succession, compensation, and talent information. |
| 4 | Manager asks for successor suggestions when coverage is missing or incomplete. |
| 5 | Manager reviews a recommended candidate before confirming. |
| 6 | Manager confirms the successor and the succession plan creation flow runs. |

#### Step 1 - Overview Panel Initial Display

Succession Overview Advisor routes the initial display request to a succession overview workflow call with the `successionDetails` message. The rendered list focuses on direct reports and highlights plan availability and readiness gaps.

| Column | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employee Name | Direct report name. | Succession details lookup output. |
| Job Title | Current assignment or role title. | Succession details lookup output. |
| Succession plan availability | Whether the employee has one or more succession plans. | Succession plan count. |
| Readiness categories | Ready Now, Ready in 1-2 Years, Ready in 3-4 Years, and No Readiness candidate counts or names where available. | Succession readiness data. |

Employees without succession plans are configured as high-priority actions, and rows pass the selected employee and manager context into follow-up actions.

#### Step 2 - Expanded Panel View

The expanded panel uses route handling inside the overview advisor to show three related views without leaving the workspace.

| Expanded view | Functional content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Impact Of Loss | Employee name, impact level, and impact score. | `impactOfLoss` workflow message. |
| Risk Of Loss | Employee name, risk level, and risk score. | `riskOfLoss` workflow message. |
| Succession Information | Employee succession summary and readiness coverage. | `successionDetails` workflow message. |

#### Step 3 - Review Employee Details

When the manager opens an employee row, the workflow parses the row payload and gathers succession, salary, and talent rating information for the selected person.

| Field | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Selected employee name. | Succession details lookup. |
| Assignment | Current assignment or job. | Succession details lookup. |
| Annual Salary | Current annual salary. | Compensation details lookup. |
| Quartile and Quintile | Compensation positioning. | Compensation details lookup. |
| Performance | Current performance rating. | Talent ratings lookup. |
| Risk of Loss | Employee risk rating. | Talent ratings lookup. |
| Impact of Loss | Employee impact rating. | Talent ratings lookup. |
| Succession Plan Count | Number of succession plans. | Succession details lookup. |
| Readiness Categories | Candidate counts and names by readiness horizon. | Succession details lookup. |

#### Step 4 - Suggest Successor

When successor suggestions are requested, the overview advisor invokes Potential Succession Candidates with the selected employee and manager context. The result is parsed and displayed as a candidate list.

| Column | Content | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Candidate name. | Potential succession candidates workflow output. |
| Current Job Title | Candidate current role. | Potential succession candidates workflow output. |
| Fit Score | Candidate fit score as returned by the workflow. | Potential succession candidates workflow output. |
| Action | Candidate review or add-successor action. | Configured app actions. |

#### Step 5 - Review Candidate

Candidate review combines successor candidate data with succession, salary, and talent rating context for the selected candidate. The generated detail view includes candidate identity, job, fit score, common skills, and matching competencies when those fields are present in the candidate payload.

#### Step 6 - Confirm And Create

The successor creation path builds a succession plan payload, retrieves employee profile information needed for plan creation, calls the create-plan service, and adds incumbents to the created plan. The configured app action also includes a refresh step so the overview can show updated succession information after the action completes.
