#### Workflow : Ledger Insights Context Workflow

| Workflow Name | Ledger Insights Context Workflow |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Code** | XX_FIN_GL_LEDGER_INSIGHTS_CONTEXT_WORKFLOW |
| **Description** | This workflow identifies the user's preferred default ledger and available ledger access, then initializes or switches the active ledger context based on the specified ledger to ensure all subsequent operations are performed in the correct financial context. |
